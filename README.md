# Task-4
I worked on the DVD rental database and extracted a set of insights using SQL queries. I first used the distinct function to identify the different movie ratings available in the database. Next, I applied an aggregate function on the replacement cost field to obtain information related to revenue. I then used the order by function to sort the data based on different columns for better organization and analysis. Finally, I performed a left join operation to combine data from two related tables and generate a consolidated result. These steps allowed me to structure the data in a way that can be further analyzed for meaningful insights.
